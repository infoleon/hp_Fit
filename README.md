and in manuscript: (under review).

### How to use it?
•	Put all the files in the same folder.
•	Edit the configurations in configuration.cfg with any text editor.
•	Edit to insert the observed data points in file data.hpf with any text editor.
•	Run the Python Script or exe file.

### Software information:
The Python script uses third party library: <a href="https://numpy.org/">numpy</a><br>
The present version of the software only fits the van Genuchten - Mualem model, more models will be added shortly. A cleaner Python code with more options will be developed.

The fitting of the conductivity function based on water content and conductivity data is not always working smoothly.</br>
